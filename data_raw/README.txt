# Grip Strength and Frailty Analysis

# Project Overview
This project analyzes the grip strength of female participants in relation to frailty status. The goal is to determine whether there is a significant difference in grip strength between frail and non-frail individuals based on various demographic factors.

# Dataset
The dataset used for this analysis contains the following columns:
- Height: Height of the participant in inches.
- Weight: Weight of the participant in pounds.
- Age: Age of the participant in years.
- Grip strength: Grip strength measured in kilograms.
- Frailty: Qualitative attribute indicating the presence ('Y') or absence ('N') of frailty symptoms.
